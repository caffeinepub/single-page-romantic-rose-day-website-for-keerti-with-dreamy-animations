  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page Rose Day UI with centered hero image, romantic copy, animated gradient background overlays (bokeh/dust/sparkles), floating petals and scroll-reactive hearts, plus a footer message. However, the required generated image assets are not present in the diff, and unrelated Internet Identity/auth/actor plumbing is introduced despite being a non-goal.",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Add generated static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated (hero illustration and overlay texture) and render them via static paths (no backend endpoints).",
      "reason": "The UI references the two required PNGs via /assets/generated/... but the diff does not add any files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the required generated assets themselves are not implemented in the change set.",
