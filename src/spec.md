# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page romantic “digital love letter” website dedicated to Keerti with a dreamy pastel aesthetic, centered hero composition, and soft animations.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single vertically-stacked page layout with full-viewport dreamy gradient background, centered hero area, headline/subtitle, and footer.
- Add subtle animated overlay layers (sparkles, glowing dust particles, and bokeh) that drift slowly and perform smoothly.
- Add a centered hero illustration showing a hand offering a deep red rose to Keerti accepting it, with a gentle glow and floating rose petal animations.
- Render the exact headline “Happy Rose Day, My Love Keerti 🌹” with cursive styling, soft glow, and a subtle shimmer/pulsing effect; render the exact subtitle beneath it in an elegant complementary font.
- Add smooth fade-in/slide-in animations for hero and text on initial load, plus soft heart/rose petal effects that appear or intensify on scroll.
- Add a bottom footer message reading exactly “Forever Yours ❤️”, styled subtly to match the theme.
- Define and apply a coherent romantic theme system (blush/peach/cream/warm gold palette; consistent typography/spacing), avoiding a blue/purple-dominant look.
- Add generated static image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and reference them directly from the frontend (no backend image serving).

**User-visible outcome:** A single-page, dreamy pastel Rose Day love-letter site for Keerti with a centered romantic hero illustration, glowing romantic text, gentle animations, and a soft themed footer.
